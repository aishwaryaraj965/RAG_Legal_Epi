From the context provided, it appears that there are different educational requirements depending on the type of licensure being sought:

1. For a person seeking licensure pursuant to § 32-2912, subsection A (medical doctors), the education requirement is completing a course of study at a school or college that offers a course of study approved or accredited by the association of American medical colleges, the association of Canadian medical colleges, the American medical association, the American osteopathic association, or any board-approved similar body in the United States or Canada that accredits this course of study. [AZ ST § 32-2901(a)]

2. For a person seeking licensure pursuant to § 32-2912, subsection B (homeopathic doctors), the education requirement is completing a course of study at a school or college that on successful completion results in a degree of doctor of homeopathy and that is approved or accredited by the accreditation body for this specific field. [Context does not provide specific information about the accreditation body for homeopathic doctors.]

So, the options provided are not directly applicable to these educational requirements. Instead, the answer would be: high school diploma (as a starting point) followed by completion of an approved or accredited course of study in medicine or homeopathy. However, it's important to note that I can't confirm whether this is sufficient for licensure as the text does not explicitly state that a high school diploma is a prerequisite.

The most relevant sections appear to be § 16-85-7 of HI ADC and § 453-4 of HI ST.

From § 16-85-7 (p. 2), it is shown that if applying as a resident in training, a letter verifying the starting and ending dates of employment as a resident or acceptance for residency training is required [1]. Additionally, a written summary of the applicant’s medical, educational, and professional background is needed if applying for an educational teaching license [2].

From § 453-4 (p. 3), it is shown that applicants who are licensed in another state by virtue of having passed a state-produced examination may qualify for licensure if they have passed the Special Purpose Examination (SPEX) or the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Variable-Purpose Examination--USA (COMVEX-USA). If an applicant has been associated with an authority during their training or practice, letters of evaluation, professional evaluation forms, and interviews may also be required [3].

In summary, if yes, the education or qualification requirements include having passed a state-produced examination, such as SPEX or COMVEX-USA, verifying employment as a resident or acceptance for residency training, providing a written summary of the applicant’s medical, educational, and professional background, and possibly additional evaluation materials.

Death Investigation Training., NH ADC Jus 2002.05(c)(1)]. Therefore, the education or qualification requirements seem to include practical experience in death investigations and autopsies.
